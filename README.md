# Setup-and-Use-a-Firewall-on-Windows-Linux
This task involved configuring a firewall to block insecure Telnet connections (port 23) while keeping SSH (port 22) accessible. The process included creating the rule, testing it to confirm the block, and then restoring the firewall to its original state. Documentation and screenshots are provided for each step.
